三幕劇版
先讓英雄救貓咪的Blake Snyder’s “Save the Cat!” Beat Sheet

Act One: Setup
Opening Image: Show the state of the world with the peculiar creatures emerging and the gods withdrawing to their realm for safety. This sets the tone for a world in chaos and transition.
Theme Stated: The theme could be subtly hinted at during these early scenes – perhaps something about balance, the cost of power, or the nature of courage.
Set-Up: Introduce the protagonist, a human child, whose parents are researchers at the magic university. The chaos caused by the Berserker Kingdom and the malfunctioning barriers.
Catalyst: The protagonist loses contact with their parents amidst the chaos, leading them to flee, eventually ending up in the Elven Forest.
Debate: The protagonist, now somewhat older and feeling outcast in the Elven Forest, decides to leave for the Port City. This internal conflict sets the stage for their journey.
Act Two: Confrontation
Break into Two: The protagonist’s journey from the Elven Forest to the Port City signifies entering a new world - one filled with dangers and opportunities.
B Story: Introduce a subplot, perhaps involving a group or individual in the Port City that will aid in the protagonist’s growth and mirror the main theme.
Fun and Games: The protagonist takes on a high-paying job to transport supplies but ends up on the front lines of battle, getting knocked out.
Midpoint: The protagonist is picked up by a dwarf warrior and reluctantly becomes part of the Berserker raids. This is a false victory as the protagonist is safe but at a moral cost.
Bad Guys Close In: Tension builds as the protagonist’s mentor refuses to return to the village, despite a prophecy calling the Berserkers back.
Act Three: Resolution
All Is Lost: The protagonist, now separated from the Berserkers, reaches the Empire. The Empire ignores the prophecy, adding to the sense of impending doom.
Break into Three: The appearance of special monsters from the west and the protagonist’s decision to seek knowledge in the Necromancer area marks the final push against the threat.
Finale: As massive hordes of monsters emerge, the protagonist and allies attempt to use sealing spells. The temporary calm is shattered by the emergence of a black sun and the revival of the Demon God.
Final Image: The climactic battle with the Demon God. This final image should reflect the change from the opening image and resonate with the theme. Remember, while this structure provides a scaffold, it’s important to weave character development, world-building, and thematic elements throughout these beats. The protagonist’s journey should not just be physical but also emotional and philosophical, reflecting the broader themes of your narrative.
