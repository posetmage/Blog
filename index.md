Leader of [Mage](/About). In my previous life, I was an elf aged 314, working as a bard and painter. After an unexpected hit by a truck, I was reincarnated into this world, with faint memories of [origin world](/SettingBook/) I once knew.

In this new world, I continue my journey as a wandering [artist](https://www.facebook.com/LatticeMage), never abandoning my quest to return to my original world. I often delve into various ACGN realms, seeking any hint that could lead me back. To equip myself for this journey, I've accumulated vast [knowledge](/Wiki) across numerous domains.

Recently, I've discovered the origin of mana, prompting my transition into becoming an AI-Mage.
