Very cute game. remind me recettear.
First time play is attracting, but game system is boring on dungeon, restaurant.

* The dungeon need run long boring path until fight boss. This is wasting time to clean path with carefully. However, this is not soul-like hardcore game.

* The roguelike map is redundant. If short will be fun. But long path trigger fast full backpack. That is, most collected items need drop. This is very bad feeling.

* Equip upgrade is not meaningful and hard to combine good set building. Moreover, the upgrade did not help battle much. High level equip still need exhausted clean the path.

* Restaurant boring also, need shuttle run to collect cash and cooking. If the upgrade is higher level, need run longer. that is stupid.

Compare to recettear, a 17 year old game still better than this one.

I love the art, forest bgm, ..... and nothing else.
