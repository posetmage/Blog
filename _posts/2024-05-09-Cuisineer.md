Very cute game. remind me recettear.
First time play is attracting, but game system is boring on dungeon, restaurant.

* The dungeon need run long boring path until fight boss. This is wasting time to clean path with carefully. However, this is not soul-like hardcore game.

* The roguelike map is redundant. If short will be fun. But long path trigger fast full backpack. That is, most collected items need drop. This is very bad feeling.

* Equip upgrade is not meaningful and hard to combine good set building. Moreover, the upgrade did not help battle much. High level equip still need exhausted clean the path.

* Restaurant boring also, need shuttle run to collect cash and cooking. If the upgrade is higher level, need run longer. that is stupid.

Compare to recettear, a 17 year old game still better than this one.

I love the art, forest bgm, ..... and nothing else.

"I've been following a game called Cuisineer from its early stages, which I first saw in indie game competitions where it was still in unfinished form. Now that the finished product is on the market, it initially felt fresh to play. However, various poor designs become increasingly frustrating for players as the game progresses. It also features absurdly painful designs at higher levels...

It's not even close to Recettear from 17 years ago. Since this is a section for sharing experiences, I guess I'll have to promote Recettear instead! XD

Reading other people's reviews, I realized that my perspective as a planner is not up to par. XD I forgot to analyze while playing.

The maps are overrun with monsters. Instinctively, I played using a large hammer and didn't notice that I didn't want to use any other weapons. Other people wrote negative reviews because the maps are so full of monsters that players can only use AOE weapons to clear the map.

The inventory is too small, and dying causes you to drop everything from your bag. The map is very long, making the bag fill up easily (actually, I ended up deleting items while fighting or just not picking them up). The bosses are located at the deepest parts, making it risky to reach them with a full bag (if you don't win, all the items collected along the way are lost). It's hard to keep full health until you reach the boss, and after defeating a boss, you have to delete items from your bag to pick up the loot.
The worst part is that you can't compare items; you can only choose to delete items from your bag before you can pick up new ones.

Defeating the first boss wasn't a big issue, but as the game progresses, it gets worse. After clearing the 3rd floor, you have to reach the 6th floor to fight the second boss. By the 2nd floor, my bag was already full. After defeating the first boss, I still had to travel a long distance to the second boss (doubling the risk of death). It's almost like you have to reach the 6th floor unscathed after beating the first boss. It's a souls-like gameplay method (with 100 HP, small enemies hit for 5-20, and bosses hit for 20-30, with a group of small enemies on the way hurting more than the boss itself).

The entire game experience was frustrating to the max. XD Even I, a player who used to grind for gear in the D2 era, couldn't stand it and changed my positive review to a negative one.

(Recettear also drops everything on death except for three items, but you can choose three items, at least keeping important equipment or materials. Also, the bag doesn't fill up easily, and you can take items with you after defeating a boss.)"
